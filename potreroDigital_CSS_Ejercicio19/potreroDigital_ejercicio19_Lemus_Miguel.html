                <p>“Fortunately, I don’t get stage fright,” he explained later. “I just get rest-of-life fright.” “Those Counting Crows, I’m telling you, that’s it,” Letterman said earnestly afterward. “We don’t need any more new bands. That’s it. That’s
                    all you need right there. Those guys are unbelievable.” Professional rock writers, meanwhile, have also been generally positive, if a tad more reserved, about Counting Crows.

                <p>As he wanders the halls of a Paris museum in search of some impressionists, Adam Duritz–the eminently recognizable fellow at the top of Counting Crows’ pecking order–has just been spotted by a pair of vaguely Beavis and Butt-head-like
                    tourists. Patiently, Duritz tries to explain to the twosome that, no, he’s not Mr. Jones. Rather he’s just the guy who sings the song of the same name, a composition in which the narrator happens to be addressing someone else named
                    Mr. Jones. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, such vague subtleties of the creative process appear to be entirely lost on these excited teens. “Amazing song, man,” says one. “Nice meeting ya, Mr. Jones,” the pal says, chiming in. “Believe me,
                    that’s not so bad,” Duritz says with a laugh once they walk away. “I mean, someone came up to me and said, ‘Hey, man, I think I finally figured the whole thing out.

        <p>“Our next guests are one of the best new bands around,” he said, “and this is their debut album here. It’s entitled August and Everything After. And I’m telling you something, if you don’t have a copy of this, there’s something wrong with you.”
            Thus warmly welcomed, the band–lead singer and main songwriter Duritz, rhythm guitarist Dave Bryson, bassist Matt Malley, lead guitarist Dan Vickrey, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist Charlie Gillingham and drummer Steve Bowman–launched
            into an edgy yet somehow stately rendition of “Round Here,” the sprawling, devastating song of disillusionment that opens August and Everything After. The band was tight and focused, with Duritz, especially, in fine form.
